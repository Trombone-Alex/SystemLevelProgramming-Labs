# SystemLevelProgramming-Labs
A branch of all my C projects in System Level Programming

Each file can be compiled and executed through GCC (https://gcc.gnu.org/)

Once GCC is installed, the command "gcc -o (command name) (file name)" in the command prompt will compile the C file. 
NOTE: (command name) is the command you want to use to execute the file and (file name) is the file you want to compile.

To run the file, type ./(command name)
